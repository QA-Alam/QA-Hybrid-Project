/*	* *
      @BeforeGroups
      The list of groups that this configuration method will run before. This method is 
       guaranteed to run shortly before the first test method that belongs to any
       of these groups is invoked.
       
       @AfterGroups
       The list of groups that this configuration method will run after. This method is 
        guaranteed to run shortly after the last test method that belongs to any of these
        groups is invoked.
        
       @DataProvider
	   Marks a method as supplying data for a test method. The annotated method must 
	   return an Object[ ][ ], where each Object[ ] can be assigned the parameter list of
	   the test method. The @Test method that wants to receive data from this 
	   DataProvider needs to use a dataProvider name equals to the name of this annotation.
	   
	    @Listeners
	    Defines listeners on a test class.
	   
	    @Parameters
        Describes how to pass parameters to a @Test method.
